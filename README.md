# covid-19
it is desktop based application

COVID-19 Desktop Application:
(ONLINE APP)

We make a DESKTOP APPICATION, in which you are familier about the COVID-19 informations such as cases, deaths and recovered cases.

Firstly, check the important informations:

1. OVERVIEW:
       In overview ,, it gives the information about WHOLE world such as total cases, total deaths and recovered cases.

2. ACTIVE CASES:
       It also give the active information about the whole world.

3. CLOSED CASES:
       It also give the closed information about the whole world.

4. COUNTRY:
       In this window, you familier about your country, and the others countries,, enter the country name,,such as search about pakistan, it gives the information about it,, but important thing is if you want to search about USA,, then you simply enter the Us, and if you want to search SOUTH AFRICA,, the in the middle put -,i.e SOUTH-AFRICA,,, 
       if you cannot put - then it cannot give you information about it,,, if there is a space in country name,, then put in the -

5. WORLD & GRAPH:
       It shows you table in which there is a different countries names and there is a graph of the whole countries.


7. TEST PROCESS:
       It is actually a chatbot,, in which you can type firstly hi,, then it says how are you,, you type,,if you are fine then type fine and if not then type ill,,,
       and chatbot asked a certain questions from you to check the symptoms ,, if symptoms occurs then chatbot says yes ,,, and no symptoms then simply no.







Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. [1] It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. [2, 3] On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009. [4] 
Illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was termed COVID-19 by the WHO, the acronym derived from "coronavirus disease 2019." The name was chosen to avoid stigmatizing the virus's origins in terms of populations, geography, or animal associations. [5, 6] On February 11, 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses issued a statement announcing an official designation for the novel virus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [7] 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that SARS-CoV-2 entered the United States in late January or early February, establishing low-level community spread before being noticed. [8] Since that time, the United States has experienced widespread infections, with more than 130,000 deaths reported.
On April 3, 2020, the CDC issued a recommendation that the general public, even those without symptoms, should begin wearing face coverings in public settings where social-distancing measures are difficult to maintain in order to abate the spread of COVID-19. [9] 
The CDC had postulated that this situation could result in large numbers of patients requiring medical care concurrently, resulting in overloaded public health and healthcare systems and, potentially, elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC advised that nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will serve as the most important response strategy in attempting to delay viral spread and to reduce disease impact. [10] 
The feasibility and implications of strategies for suppression and mitigation have been rigorously analyzed and are being encouraged or enforced by many governments in order to slow or halt viral transmission. Population-wide social distancing of the entire population plus other interventions (eg, home self-isolation, school and business closures) was strongly advised. These policies may be required for long periods to avoid rebound viral transmission. [11] 
According to the CDC, individuals at high risk of infection include persons in areas with ongoing local transmission, healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19, close contacts of infected persons, and travelers returning from locations where local spread has been reported. [10] 
Person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in the United States. [12, 13] Individuals who believe they may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should contact their healthcare provider.

The CDC has also provided recommendations for individuals who are at high risk of COVID-19–related complications, including older adults and persons who have serious underlying health conditions (eg, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease). Such individuals should consider the following precautions: [14] 
Stock up on supplies. 
Avoid close contact with sick people. 
Wash hands often. 
Stay home as much as possible in locations where COVID-19 is spreading. 
Develop a plan in case of illness. 
Healthcare personnel are also referred to Medscape’s Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resource Center for the latest news, perspective, and resources.
Signs and symptoms
Presentations of COVID-19 have ranged from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and mortality. Symptoms may develop 2 days to 2 weeks following exposure to the virus. [15] A pooled analysis of 181 confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, China, found the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days and that 97.5% of individuals who developed symptoms did so within 11.5 days of infection. [16] 

Wu and McGoogan reported that, among 72,314 COVID-19 cases reported to the Chinese Center for disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 81% were mild (absent or mild pneumonia), 14% were severe (hypoxia, dyspnea, >50% lung involvement within 24-48 hours), 5% were critical (shock, respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction), and 2.3% were fatal. [17] 

The following symptoms may indicate COVID-19: [18] 
Fever or chills 
Cough 
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
Fatigue 
Muscle or body aches 
Headache 
New loss of taste or smell 
Sore throat 
Congestion or runny nose 
Nausea or vomiting 
Diarrhea 

Other reported symptoms have included the following:
Sputum production 
Malaise 
Respiratory distress 

The most common serious manifestation of COVID-19 appears to be pneumonia.

A complete or partial loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) has been reported as a potential history finding in patients eventually diagnosed with COVID-19. [19] A phone survey of outpatients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 found that 64.4% (130 of 202) reported any altered sense of smell or taste. [20] 

Symptoms in children with infection appear to be uncommon, although some children with severe COVID-19 have been reported. [17, 21, 22] 

See Clinical Presentation.

Diagnosis

COVID-19 should be considered a possibility in (1) patients with respiratory tract symptoms and newly onset fever or (2) in patients with severe lower respiratory tract symptoms with no clear cause. Suspicion is increased if such patients have been in an area with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or have been in close contact with an individual with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the preceding 14 days.

Microbiologic (PCR) testing is required for definitive diagnosis. At present, such testing is of limited availability.

Patients who do not require emergency care are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider over the phone. Patients with suspected COVID-19 who present to a healthcare facility should prompt infection-control measures. They should be evaluated in a private room with the door closed (an airborne infection isolation room is ideal) and asked to wear a surgical mask. All other standard contact and airborne precautions should be observed, and treating healthcare personnel should wear eye protection. [23] 

See Workup.

Management

The antiviral drug remdesivir gained emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA on May 1, 2020, based on preliminary data showing a faster time to recovery of hospitalized patients with severe disease. [24, 25, 26] Numerous other antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines continue to be investigated and developed as potential therapies. Further data on remdesivir suggest that it shortens the time to recovery in hospitalized adults. [27] 

In addition, infected patients should receive supportive care to help alleviate symptoms. Vital organ function should be supported in severe cases. [28] 

No vaccine is currently available for SARS-CoV-2. Avoidance is the principal method of deterrence.

Numerous collaborative efforts to discover and evaluate effectiveness of antivirals, immunotherapies, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines have rapidly emerged. Guidelines and reviews of pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 have been published. [29, 30, 31, 32]
